# 3D Software Renderer Project Plan

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Foundation (2 weeks)
1. Set up development environment (Visual Studio 2022, CMake)
2. Create GitHub repository and initial project structure
3. Implement basic vector and matrix operations (2D and 3D)
4. Set up unit testing framework (Minunit.h)
5. Implement dynamic arrays for memory management
6. Create initial documentation structure

## Phase 2: Basic Rendering Pipeline (3 weeks)
1. Implement point projection and linear transformations
2. Develop line drawing algorithm
3. Create triangle and vertex data structures
4. Implement basic triangle rasterization
5. Develop OBJ file parser
6. Implement depth sorting algorithm for faces
7. Create a basic camera system

## Phase 3: Advanced Rendering Features (4 weeks)
1. Implement 3D matrix transformations
2. Develop projection matrix
3. Implement basic lighting and shading
4. Create texture mapping system
5. Implement perspective-correct texture mapping
6. Develop PNG file decoder for textures
7. Implement Z-buffer for depth testing
8. Enhance OBJ file support to include textures

## Phase 4: Optimization and Polish (3 weeks)
1. Implement clipping algorithms
2. Optimize rendering pipeline
3. Add support for multiple meshes
4. Implement further optimizations (to be identified during development)
5. Refine and optimize existing features

## Phase 5: Testing and Documentation (2 weeks)
1. Conduct thorough testing of all components
2. Write comprehensive documentation
3. Create usage examples and tutorials
4. Perform code review and refactoring

## Phase 6: Final Integration and Playdate Specific Features (2 weeks)
1. Ensure compliance with Playdate SDK and coding style
2. Implement Playdate-specific optimizations
3. Create demo applications showcasing renderer capabilities
4. Final testing on Playdate hardware

## Phase 7: Project Wrap-up and Future Planning (1 week)
1. Finalize all documentation
2. Create a list of potential future features and improvements
3. Prepare project presentation and final report

Total Estimated Time: 17 weeks

Note: This timeline is an initial estimate and may need to be adjusted as the project progresses. Regular progress reviews and timeline adjustments should be conducted throughout the development process.
